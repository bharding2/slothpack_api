## congratulations, you made it to this branch!

#### this is the rest_api and angular client rolled into one package.
* run `node server.js` to launch the api
* `gulp build:dev` to build the angular client
* run `node build_server.js` to serve the angular client to the browser via localhost
* for testing you will need Karma and Protractor installed globally
* to run the full battery of tests, just run `gulp` to get the default task
